Turn your notes into a quiz

This app helps you study by hiding less frequent words in your document, so you can test your memory and fill in the hidden words.
It's inspired by flashcards; it automates the writing of the "cards" by keeping the original with hidden words.

The program works with ÃšFAL's MorphoDiTa library and the default language is czech.
The language can be changed by providing a different language model and a lemmatized corpus.
